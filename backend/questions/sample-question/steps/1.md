# Step 1: Create your namespace

Before you begin working with ConfigMaps, you need to create your own namespace (project) in OpenShift.

Enter a name for your namespace in the field above and click "Create Namespace" button.

**Note:** If the namespace already exists, it will be deleted and recreated.

After you've created your namespace, click the "Check" button to verify and proceed to the next step.

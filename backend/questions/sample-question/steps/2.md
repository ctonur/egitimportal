# Step 2: Create a ConfigMap

Now that you have your namespace ready, let's create a ConfigMap named `app-config` with a simple key-value pair.

Run the following command to create the ConfigMap:

```bash
oc create configmap app-config --from-literal=environment=production --from-literal=log-level=info -n YOUR_NAMESPACE
```

Make sure to replace `YOUR_NAMESPACE` with the namespace you created in Step 1.

After running the command, click the "Check" button to verify that the ConfigMap was created successfully.

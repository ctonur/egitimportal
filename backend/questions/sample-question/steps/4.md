# Step 4: Add a JSON file to the ConfigMap

ConfigMaps can also store entire files. Let's add a JSON configuration file to our ConfigMap.

First, create a JSON file with the following content:

```bash
echo '{"cache": true, "timeout": 5000}' > config.json
```

Now, update the ConfigMap to include this file:

```bash
oc create configmap app-config --from-file=config.json -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --dry-run=client -o yaml | oc replace -f -
```

Make sure to replace `YOUR_NAMESPACE` with your namespace name.

This command creates a new version of the ConfigMap that includes the file, then replaces the existing ConfigMap with this new version.

Click the "Check" button to verify that the file was added to the ConfigMap successfully.

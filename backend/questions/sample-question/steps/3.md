# Step 3: Verify the ConfigMap data

Now let's verify that the ConfigMap has the correct data. We need to check if the 'environment' value is set to 'production'.

Run the following command to examine the ConfigMap:

```bash
oc get configmap app-config -n YOUR_NAMESPACE -o yaml
```

Make sure to replace `YOUR_NAMESPACE` with your namespace name.

You should see both keys (`environment` and `log-level`) with their values in the output.

Click the "Check" button to verify that the 'environment' key is set correctly to 'production'.
